AdMerk Corp. Inc. has created an open-source repository named RefugeeSupport on GitHub and seeking the contributions of technical and non-technical persons worldwide wanting to do good in the world.

That is why we need your assistance to help us improve the platform that matches refugees and immigrants with caring sponsors or forward thinking companies to hire and to allow them to begin a new life and achieve self-sufficiency.

AdMerk's platform is simple, but effective: refugees and immigrants create profiles that highlight their skills, experience, and interests, and potential sponsors and companies can browse these profiles to find candidates who meet their requirements. Once a match is made, the two parties can communicate and build a relationship that will eventually lead to a successful sponsorship.

In order to improve rapidly on our efforts and goals to help as many refugees and those immigrants who are in search of a better life and income in a foreign country, we open our code on Github whereby technical and non-technical contributors can help us find unique and innovative solutions that can improve the lives of refugees and immigrants in search of a new beginning.

We are embracing open-source and innovation by inviting contributors to join us in making the world a better place by opening up our code to incorporate AI in our technological infrastructure and developments to save the users of our platform valuable time.

Yes, your contribution is essential and will make a difference to improve the lives of highly motivated refugees to find work in their new adopt communities, new or seasoned immigrants as well as local jobseekers.

In addition, forward thinking companies will have an excellent opportunity to tap into a diverse pool of talents to hire on our platform. Contributing developers, technical and non-technical contributors can also gain valuable experience while making a positive difference in the world.

Join us in making the world more inclusive and welcoming to refugees and immigrants who are not afraid of the unknown and ready to take any type of job to support their family in a peaceful and positive environment.

Yes, we can make a real difference in the lives of millions of people around the world who are looking for a fresh start in life with your help. Join our open-source project on GitHub.
